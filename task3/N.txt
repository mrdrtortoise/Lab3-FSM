N is between 19 and 20 for this comuter (desktop)
closer to 20

when I switched to the challenge yourself I had to increase N to double of what was calibrated, 
as the calibration was actually 0.5 seconds. This is because we were basically doing two "state switches"
in one second. first to turn the light off and then turn them on again. since we want to do one state transition
in one second, N has to be increased.
